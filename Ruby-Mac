# Setting up Ruby on the Mac
The Mac OS depends on an old version of Ruby so you cannot upgrade and use that base installation. Instead, we must install a Ruby Version Manager and configure our terminals to use the new version for our own local development.

## Ruby
Jekyll's documentation recomends using chruby so that's what we will use.

*Reference: https://mac.install.guide/ruby/12.html

1. Install ruby-install and chruby
```zsh
brew install ruby-install chruby
```

2. After installing, you'll see the following instructions in the terminal. 
3. Copy the lines in your terminal that say "source".
```bash
==> chruby
Add the following to the ~/.bash_profile or ~/.zshrc file:
  source /opt/homebrew/opt/chruby/share/chruby/chruby.sh

To enable auto-switching of Rubies specified by .ruby-version files,
add the following to ~/.bash_profile or ~/.zshrc:
  source /opt/homebrew/opt/chruby/share/chruby/auto.sh

```

4. Create a zsh terminal profile file if you do not already have one
```zsh
touch ~/.zshrc  
```

5. Open the file in Text Edit
```zsh
open -e ~/.zshrc
```

6. Paste the two source lines identified in step 3
```text
source /opt/homebrew/opt/chruby/share/chruby/chruby.sh
source /opt/homebrew/opt/chruby/share/chruby/auto.sh
```

7. Save the file (But leave open).

8. Refresh your terminal with the following command. This will reload terminal with your profile paths

```zsh
exec zsh
```

9. Finall, install the latest version of Ruby
```zsh
ruby-install ruby
```

10. Add the following line to the end of your zsh terminal profile (Still open from step 6).
```text
chruby ruby-3.2.0
```

11. Save the file, and refresh your terminal.
```zsh
exec zsh
```

# Ruby Frameworks

## Jekyll
Jekyll requires the latest version of Ruby. See instructions above to install correctly.

1. Check your version of Ruby by opening a terminal

```zsh
ruby --version
```
*As of the time of this writing, we are on Ruby version 3.2.0

2. If the current version is installed, install Jekyll:
```zsh
gem install jekyll
```

*Note: If running Ruby >= 3.2 and recieving an error called "tainted?": update liquid.
```zsh
bundle update liquid
```
