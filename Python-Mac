# Setting up Python on the Mac
Download the latest version of Python and install manually. If your project requires an older version of Python to run, you can install older versions or initiate the process of upgrading the project to run on the newest stable version of Python.

## Version Management
We use Pipenv to manage language versioning for our python projects. This tool allows you to create a virtual envelope (VENV) for each project and install dependancies there instead of mucking up the base installation for all users.

# Installing pipenv
```zsh
sudo -H pip3 install -U pipenv
```

# Frameworks
To install django for a new project, first create a VENV in your project directory

```zsh
pipenv install
```

Activate the VENV
```zsh
pipenv shell
```

Check your python version
```zsh
python3 --version
```

Install Django
```zsh
pip install django
```

Check your Django version
```zsh
python3 -m django --version
```
